/**
 * Offers a set of class-scoped convenience methods for interacting with
 * Cucumber language and runtime.
 *
 * Typically, your unit tests will interact via this interface, rather
 * than via the Cucumber shared language, or some other instance of the language
 * class.
 *
 * All the class-scoped methods access the shared runtime's language, rather
 * than the shared language. Typically this amounts to exactly the same
 * thing. The answer differs only in one case: when the runtime overrides the
 * language. In that case, the runtime takes precedence.
